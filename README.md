# Wbc-Classification-using-Yolov3
- This project deals with the detection and classification of White Blood cells(WBCs) using deep learning object detection architecture called YOLOv3.
- The model performs the task by detecting WBCs from blood images using YOLOv3 and a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) called Darknet53.
- The detection and classification of WBCs can aid in detection and diagnosis of Leukaemia 
- The model is built using Pytorch API
